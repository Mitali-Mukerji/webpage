### About

Social media has become an essential part of daily life. People use social networking platforms to share their thoughts, proposals, and activities. We can hardly imagine any event without Facebook or Twitter posts. This is even true for natural disasters and activities such as agitations, accidents, or crimes. In other words, any physical event finds its place in social networks. Social network activities often precede the actual event or before it reaches mainstream media \cite{McMinn2013}. This observation leads to one question: "Can we predict or find real-world events from social media data streams?"
